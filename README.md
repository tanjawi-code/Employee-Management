- Introduction

This is a simple program of managing employees. with a lot of tools and things you can do in this program.

## Project description
This program allows to manage employees and their types (Fix employee, hourly employee, commission employee, and
base plus commission employee). You are allowed to :
- Enter employees' details and their types.
- Manage employees' details (add employee, remove employee, show all employee, ect).
- Modify their details (salary, bonus, deduction, number of working hours, and sold products).
- Search for an employee by the ID or name.
- See statistics (number of the employees, number of every type of the employees, highest earning, lowest earning,
number of sold products in the company, ect).
- Check every employee earning in any type.
- Provide a simple screen of dealing with the program.

## To-Do list.
- [  ] Add login screen.
- [  ] Add GUI swing to the project.
- [  ] Make things more clear and simple.
- [  ] Add changing the salary for base plus commission employees in the method (manageDetails).

## Problems I have in the program.
- Fix the problem of searching for the employee by name to modify details.
- Fix the problem of searching for the employee to remove the employee.
- Find a solution of repeating when the user enter letters instead of numbers in the second input. (Explain:
You have to enter two numbers, the first number is correct, but the second number has letters. That means you will
enter also the first number again).
- Make the program hold all the problems of (InputMismatchException) to avoid stopping the program while working. 
especially in the method (manageDetails) in class fix employees (it's the only part that does not hold the problems
of InputMismatchException).

## Future improvements.
- Add database support (MySQl or SQLite).
- Improve the project by using **JavaFx** instead of swing.
- Add multi-language support (Localization).
